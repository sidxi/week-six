BOYS WILL BE BOYS MONTHLY NEWSLETTER #6 August 1992
 
INTRO
At last, the first F2M Transgender conference is going ahead. We have secured enough interest, from those of you in NSW anyway, to proceed. Please consider coming along at this time. It will be, hopefully, an incredible experience with a lot to be gained. For you guys in Newcastle, It's only a 3hr trip to Sydney - you may wish to come for only one or more events. The more boys present, the greater variety of experiences and learning there will be. For those of you out of thetown, we can easily find a place for you to stay with other boys. If you choose not to come, you may have to wait another year before the next gathering of the "brotherhood"!

I'm really looking forward to seeing as many of you as possible.
 
NEWS 

LINK WITH CENTRAL COAST 
We recently received an introductory letterfrom Edwige who works at the Central Coast Community Women's Health Centre at Gosford. Edwige identifies as an FTM man and in his letter informs us that he is a part of a transsexual support group there. His role within the organisation is as councellor including outreach work. BWBB will be added to their resource list and I also hope that a good connection will be built between ourselves and the Central Coast.
 
JULY FTM NEWSLETTER 
We've just received the July issue of the American FTM newsletter. It's an amazing issue! There are ten crowded pages full of personal insights, reviews of gender events, cross-dressing performers, articles on FTM products, mail box, book reviews and much more! There is also a personal perspective by the editor (James) on the history of the newsletter and what the '90's holds for we men. 
We've reprinted from this issues, a couple of press releases on penis prosthesis made by other brothers. I'm sure this is of great interest to us all. I'm also pleased to say that the newsletter mentions Jasper's 
film as part of the S.F film festival. For a photocopy of this newsletter send $2.50 to BWBB or write to FTM direct (see contact list). 

NEW TERM FOR OLD FEELINGS 
Well, I've noticed in recent overseas newsletters and in some local literature also, that we transsexuals are now referring to ourselves as "transgenderists". The change in temiinology certainly makes sense, as logically, we are not changing our sexuality but our physical gender. I don't know who coined the new label but it certainly feels better than the previous one, although it takes a little getting used to. I'd be interested to see if the new term will be used within medical circles. 
As a response, from this newsletter on, BWBB will use the term transgender instead of transsexual. Hopefully this will be in agreement with everyone.
 
BUSINESS 
# Please note: All monies for material or donations should be made payable to Jasper Laybutt (pref.Postal Order) as BWBB is not a registered organisation. 
# Important: Please let us know of a change of address. Not only do we want to keep in touch with you but we don't want this sensitive document to fall into the hands of new tenants after you have left ..

Rhonnie Reed (The Herbie Maker) is announcing the introduction of his latest product: TRAMP (Totally Realistic Artificial Male Penis)! 
Rhonnie says, "With Tramp you will have the ability to stand and urinate, create an endless erection, be personally stimulated during intercourse, and look and feel totally normal. Only a real close inspection will disclose Tramp as a replacement to surgery. If you are interested in Tramp, Rhonnie will mail you an information packet. Just send a self-addressed business envelope with stamps (maybe send US$2 to cover O'seas mailing-ed).

At US$500 the Tramp is quite expensive for us here in Australia, as it works out to be closer to Aus$800 but hey, if it can do all that Rhonnie says then it's probably worth the cash. BWBB will send for information which we can print for us all to asses. Hopefully it will include photos and technical information. Anyway, if you're already interested here's the address: Creative Growth Enterprises, 4480 Treat Blvd, Suite 227 Concord, CA 94521 USA.

For a less expensive but basic prosthesis, here's what Randy Ingersoll has to say about his US$65 "Transitional Prosthesis" (TP) ... 
"At present the Transitional Prosthesis is 85% waterproof and will dry within approx 15 to 20mins. Due to the harness, the prosthesis follows your body just like a penis (here's a first, you can go without underwear or a jock strap to hold it in place). It feels real, of course this is a major concern, since women tend to me more aggressive these days and may have their hand in your crotch before you can stop them. If you happen to brush against someone accidently (or on purpose) they won't feel a hard lump in your pants and wonder what the problem is ... The prosthesis can be washed in the washer and easily dried on a towel. 
Though the TP is not an exact replica of the penis in appearance (let's face it, if they're that close they'll know it isn't real), for now I have chosen to pursue functional use. 
My interest is to keep the cost down. Each TP is handmade and takes roughly four to seven hours to make. They are available in different skin tones. the life of the TP is mostly determined by how carefully you follow the instructions which are provided. I am available to anyone who has suggestions, concerns or problems. I also guarantee complete refund if you decide that the prosthesis doesn't brig you more satisfaction and peace of mind than any other prosthesis that you have worn. 

...I will be contributing a portion of the funds from the sales of the TP to support this newsletter (FTM: US) the that it will continue to serve our population along with our concerns. In this manner your funds will help you twice. I have made quite a few TP for friends of mind, and they report that this is the best, most realistic one they have ever tried, and it is very comfortable to wear. It is undetectable, unless (of course) you are naked. I know what freedom, comfort and normalcy it has contributed in my life.

Randy states that he has experimented, modified and improved the TP to the point it is now at and will continue to do so. You can get the TP in skin colours: light, medium, dark or brown. Cost is (all in US funds) One: $65, Two: $120, Three: $375. Buy four or more at $55 each. Shipping and handling is included in price! And he s.tates that delivery can be between 2-4 weeks. Randy welcomes any feedback on his product and correspondence is confidential. 
Write to him at 315 Running Brook, Mesquite, Texas 75149 USA We'll also send for information to publish in BWBB plus clear photos.
Perhaps, if the product is good enough, a few of us can pool our funds to get the TP at the reduced rate (US$55 around $70 Aus) for four or more? 

LETTERS 
Dear Jasper, Thanks very much for the newsletter - it's great to know there are others going through similar experiences that I am and I find it all very encouraging. You mentioned a national weekend in August for F2Ms. What a great idea! Have you a date yet? I'd like to be involved in fairly structured times of sharing - operations, fears etc, with some time for one to one sharing and possibly some counseling. Your other ideas in the June newsletter sound good as well. 

Having to go through seeing a psychiatrists to have the change is frustrating, as you've found out. I was first referred Warwick WIlliams at Epping and I was glad we was the first I saw. Initially I was told I would have to wait two years before I could have the operations (any operations!). I felt as you do. I had been living as a man for at least the three previous years. My second opinon was from Dr Tony Osmond at Greenwhich and, at my fathers insistance, I also saw Corny Greenway at Drummoyne. I didn't like Corny. I suggested I tried a lesbian relationship before considering any change - a suggestion I took deep offence to as I did not see myself as a lesbian, but as a man in the wrong body. My "waiting time" was eventually reduced to roughly six months, but it wass the full twelve months before I had the double mastectomy because I couldn't afford to have them done any sooner! But that twelve months would have been the longest I've ever put in! And I was really glad when I no longer had any breasts as such. 
In hindsight though, I wish I'd had the hysterectomy done first. Why? If you rely heavily on your breasts for sexual arousal and pleasure after they are removed and your nippies are repositioned you lose all pleasurable sensation from that area. And it's bloody frustrating trying to find those same sensations anywhere else!! If you don't, then you shouldn't have too much  trouble. I don't know what you were told about the wait - I was told that there had been some who had gone through the change "too quickly" and had regretted it afterwards so the wait is now compulsory. No less frustrating though! My only hold up now is money to continue with my change. I have had more problems with my family than I ever had with doctors! Good luck and I hope your patience lasts till you get the OK to go ahead with the operations. 
Take care, Ross
