_Boys Will Be Boys_ is a sonification of the Digital Transgender Archives' copies of the Boys Will Be Boys newsletter (1992-1993), layered with linear transition moments from the transmasculine YouTube community. It explores the ways in which trans men have created community, both past and present.
