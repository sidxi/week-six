_Boys Will Be Boys_ is a sonification of the Digital Transgender Archives' copies of the Boys Will Be Boys newsletter (1992-1993), layered with linear transition moments from the transmasculine YouTube community. It explores the ways in which trans men have created community, both past and present.

## Liner Notes

On June 12th, 2020 - the anniversary of the Pulse Nightclub shooting - [the Trump administration repealed healthcare protections for transgender people](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/12/trump-transgender-lgbt-healthcare-protections). Essentially, this will allow healthcare workers to refuse care to a transgender person if they believe that serving them would violate the worker’s religious or moral beliefs. While I was already well underway on this project, that announcement made my work feel more urgent because it was another tangible recognition of the ways that trans people still experience discrimination today. As a transgender man, I am viscerally aware that there are people who believe I should not exist. To exist as a trans person is revolutionary, and to have records of that existence is essential to the survival of the trans community. In my [very first journal](https://github.com/sidxi/week-one/blob/master/journal.md), I noted that I was delighted to see the [Transgender Archives Project](https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net/) listed in [Amalia Skarlatou Levi’s Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/amaliasl/status/1245544256212807680). When Dr. Graham asked us to revisit this thread for our week six project, I immediately knew that I wanted to use artifacts from that archive. 

My project, initially, was too large in scope. I wanted to grab _all_ of the artifacts from new york city (a prominent area within the North American trans rights movement) and create a sonification from them. I rapidly realized that this project would be too big - not only could I not effectivley use wget to pull all my files, the cleaning of that data would have been an absolutely massive undertaking. So, I downsized, but in doing so I feel like I gained a richer appreciation for a small pocket of history that was previously unknown to me: the [Boys Will Be Boys (BWBB) newsletter](https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net/col/1r66j121q). BWWB was a newsletter that emerged in the early 1990s in Sydney, Australia, and it's primary function was to connect transgender men across Australia, sharing stories, and resources, as well as creating connections between people who would have otherwise been isolated. It's no [Stonewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots), but it does showcase the power of building community. 

For my analysis, I first downloaded the PDFs and pulled the text off them, creating text files. Then, I cleaned the text manually. The manual cleaning of the text was important to me because, while preparing for this project, I listened to a [2013 presentation by Michelle Moravec](http://historyinthecity.blogspot.com/2013/11/before-i-start-i-want-to-thank-people.html). While she made many salient points, one thing she said resonated with me:

_"This visualization relies only on data extracted by NER although I hand cleaned and combined the results to yield these names. **NER definitely missed some names**."_ [Emphasis mine]

I knew that the analytical tools I would be working with would be imperfect, and I hoped to manually make up for it. Actually, I specifically chose not to use OpenRefine to clean my data because it seemed to be better suited to datasets (not text files), which I had not yet created. This cleaning up process was tedious, but it helped me to identify common themes within the text and gave me a beginnign point for my dataset creation. Ultimately, I used [Voyant (link to my corpus)](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=73cf536f512e5f018906227dc85a8afe) to find common words and themes with the BWBB newsletters. I found the cirrus cloud very interesting, because it further illuminated some of the themes that had begun emerging while I was cleaning my data

Ultimately, I separated my data into the following themes:
* Words for "transgender" (ex: transsexual, transgenderist, ftm)
* Gender words (ex: masculine, daughter, brother)
* Body words (ex: penis, skin, breasts)
* Names (ex: Jamie, Rhonnie, Jasper)
* Transition words (ex: surgery, medical, testosterone)
* Happy/Community words (ex: community, support, new)
* Sexuality words (ex: gay, bisexual, lesbian)
* Locations (ex: Sydney, Melbourne, Newcastle)

I used Voyant to identify and quantify these themes, and then worked to turn them into a format that would work well for a sonification. While I initially tried giving each theme its own column, the sound was very uneven and, I felt, did not accurately communicate how my data showed how the themes all emerged within the same texts - just at different points. Ultimately, I kept all of my themes on the same track (aka, in the same column), and allowed for the music's intermittent raising of pitch to introduct the each new theme. I also kept the most prominent year that each word/word cluster emerged, to illustrate their place within linear time. 

So, I had my sonification. Here it is before I put it into Audacity:

The final product I created came from me wanting to go back to my own early spaces of trans community. For me, this was trans vloggers on YouTube, who would document their changes publicly. When I was first entering my transition, watching these transitions and learnign from their experiences was a way that I was able to feel less alone. THe "this is my voice on T/testosterone" is an immensely important auditory feature of that type of video, and as such, I wanted to incorporate it within my own final sonification. Ultimately, I hope to have been able to connect the ways that these two communities - existing decades apart - are similar. Regardless of medium, that common sharing of experiences and resources has created vital records of remembrance for other transgender individuals.
